### [BONUS] Interactive Prototype

## SPRINT PLANNING 

### Sprint 1: Set up the project & create Log-in Screen 
- [X] Finish brainstorming
- [X] Set up the project
- [X] Create Log-in page

#### Reflection: 
- It takes more time than expected to do Figma Wireframe. But it is very important to know what the app will look like.
- Should keep things simple for now so that it's not too difficult to finish the project
- Log-in page is not difficult but needs to learn how to build the registration screen

### Sprint 2: Build the Home Screen & Expense Screen
- [X] Finish Expense Screen
- [X] Finish Input New expense

#### Reflection: 
- It is not too difficult but it took a long time for me to remeber all the things we have learned and use all of them together. I had to go back to the labs and projects to see how the codes are.
- It is also confusing to have all the different functions of an app. Usually in the lab or projects we only need to do a small section of the app. But now we have to build the whole app ourselves.
- It look much longer time than expected.
- However, I did finish the sprint goal for this week. 

### Sprint 3: Build the User Profile screen.
- [X] Finish User Profile Screen

#### Reflection: 
- It still has many elements that need to be changed around.
- Need to find way for the user to upload new profile picture.
- Need a way to store their important information safely.

### Sprint 4: Build the Goal Screen
- [] Finish Goal Screen
- [] Finish Input New Goal
